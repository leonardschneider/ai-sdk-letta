"@ai-sdk-letta/server": minor
---

First public release. A local HTTP runtime for ai-sdk-letta agents: durable threads and runs, NDJSON events, exactly-once answers and cancellation, and image input on `POST /v1/runs`; `startGuiServer` for a loopback browser app (session cookie, CSRF, Origin and Host checks, strict CSP) and `startApiServer` for a token-authenticated server-to-server API.
