Add sandboxed shell commands. `sandboxTools` adds `run_command` (no network, allowed by default) and `run_command_online` (internet access, always asks), run through the AI SDK `Experimental_SandboxSession` in one isolated sandbox per conversation with the conversation's files at `/workspace`. Configure it with the definition's new `sandbox` option: `'apple-container'` (`@lgrammel/apple-container-sandbox` 1.1.0), `'docker'` (`ai-sdk-sandbox-docker` 0.1.2), both optional peer dependencies, or a custom factory. Commands get an empty environment, git without global config and a fixed identity, a timeout, abort on Stop, and capped output; pip packages persist in `/workspace/.venv`. Project folders whose git config holds credentials are refused. The tool bridge now passes the bound sandbox to tools as `experimental_sandbox` and supports per-tool timeouts.
